## What is Golang?
Go is an open source programming language that makes it simple to build secure, scalable systems.
Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google.  It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.
Go is used for server-side (backend) programming, game development, cloud-based programming, and even Data Science. It is also popular for making command-line tools.
Today, many tech giants use Go like Google, Netflix, Twitch, Ethereum, Dropbox, Kubernetes, Docker, Heroku, and lots more.
Thereâ€™s no surprise that the likes of Kubernetes, Docker, and Heroku are using Go because cloud-based programming is one of the main reasons why Go was designed.
